# Lesson 4

## Objectives

* Prove understanding and comfort with basic Python
* Apply matrix algebra and Numpy to data problems
* Understand the central functions of the Pandas library
* Be able to quickly navigate Pandas structures and documentation to find the data you need.

## Before

* [Submit a file](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B2_NWQOfrbk-eWN5SWItazBuSGc&usp=sharing) with your project idea, data sources, and audience

* Review [Python and Numpy Exercises](https://github.com/TeachingDataScience/data-science-course/tree/forstudentviewing/lesson03_numpy) from the curriculum

* Try out the [Official Pandas Tutorials](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/tutorials.html): Wes & Company's selection of tutorials and lectures

* Learn the basics of [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)
  
## During

* We'll review dictionaries, lists, and data frames with this [notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/teachingdatascience/data-science-course/blob/forstudentviewing/lesson04_pandas/lab04.ipynb).
* Given extra time, work through the "quiz" accessible [here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/TeachingDataScience/data-science-course/blob/forstudentviewing/04_pandas/Lab_04_quiz.ipynb).


## After

#### Review Pandas Again

These two 'after market' tutorials are excellent resources to further confirm your knowledge.

* [Julia Evans Pandas Cookbook](https://github.com/jvns/pandas-cookbook): Great resource with eamples from weather, bikes and 311 calls

* [Learn Pandas Tutorials](https://bitbucket.org/hrojas/learn-pandas): A great series of Pandas tutorials from Dave Rojas

#### Other links

* Those looking for a more intensive read, Hadley Wickham's paper on the [Split-Apply-Combine Strategy](http://www.jstatsoft.org/v40/i01/paper) is a fantastic read, though dense. The code is also in R (Wickham is an R developer), but the methodology still perfectly applies.

* [Research Computing Python Data PYNBs](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/ResearchComputing/Meetup-Fall-2013/tree/master/python/): There are a ton of additional data sets and lectures about pandas. Consider going through these to continue practicing your python data manipulation.
