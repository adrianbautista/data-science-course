Your Centroid or Mine? An Introduction to K-Means
======================================

Humans are good, often too good, at clustering, and its another realm of our intelligence that we can programatically apply to machines.  Toddlers can tell that objects are boats, flags, and doggies -- but how?  

Machine clustering is used to categorize the web, understand galaxies, organize genetic, segment customers, classify mental illness, and detect disease patterns, to name just a few applications.

K Means is a very simple algorithm for clustering that works well and is by far the most widely used.

Here's some resources to get started:
