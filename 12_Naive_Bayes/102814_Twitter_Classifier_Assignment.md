# Create a twitter sentiment classifier

Due 10/28/14

* Use with naive bayes and check the sentiment for a keyword of your choice.

* You'll need your own twitter api key.
* Which you get by signing in to twitter (and then searching for api key), and creating an 'application'
* Note that it doesn't matter what you call your application or what the urls you type in are.
* See the "OAuth" section from the NLTK lesson notebook for the tweet acquisition paradigm.

* For the training set, you can use the "STS-Gold Sentiment Corpus". CSV is here.  Note that you need to use `sep = ";"` as an argument, since it uses semi-colons as separators.

Your training set, in this case, is the "STS" corpus.

Once you've created your classifier, THEN, run your collected tweets through it, and report on how they scored in terms of sentiment.



Turn in a (link to your) nicely formatted notebook with your well-commented code. You can use this and the previous assignment's code as guidelines.
