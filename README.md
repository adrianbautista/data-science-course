### Getting Help

**Github Issues**

For general or specific course help, students can get the fastest response by posting an issue, to the [issues page for this repository](https://github.com/TeachingDataScience/data-science-course/issues)

* Chris will be reviewing each issue and will assign it to Ed, Dave or himself.
* Students and other instructors following the repository will also be able to address the issue, improving response time.


**Office Hours**

Ed and Dave will hold regular office hours, and Chris will hold regular weekend sessions.

### Communication

#### Watch the Github Repository

In order to see issue notifications you need to 'watch' the github repository.

You can tailor your settings to receive notifications via email, daily, weekly, etc.

If you're not already "watching" the github repository, please do so.

You can check the [watcher's list](https://github.com/TeachingDataScience/data-science-course/watchers) to see if you're on it.

And if you're not on it, you just need sign in to github, and then to click the watch button from that same page.
