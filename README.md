## Upcoming Project Activity:

* 9/24/14, Wednesday: [Dataset related to Project Due](assignments/092414_ProjectDataSet.md)
* 10/1/14 Wednesday: Presentations with your data on Exploratory Data Analysis

### Getting Help

**Github Issues**

For general or specific course help, students can get the fastest response by posting an issue, to the [issues page for this repository](https://github.com/TeachingDataScience/data-science-course/issues)

* Chris will be reviewing each issue and will assign it to Ed, Dave or himself.
* Students and other instructors following the repository will also be able to address the issue, improving response time.


**Office Hours**

Ed and Dave will hold regular office hours, and Chris will hold regular weekend sessions.

Dave's office hours are posted [here](https://accounts.google.com/ServiceLogin?service=cl&passive=1209600&continue=https://www.google.com/calendar/selfsched?sstoken%3DUUJjNUJzODlzeDdPfGRlZmF1bHR8MTQ3MjQwYzU4M2M3NmFkODRhMTdhN2Y1MDNlNjE2NGI&followup=https://www.google.com/calendar/selfsched?sstoken%3DUUJjNUJzODlzeDdPfGRlZmF1bHR8MTQ3MjQwYzU4M2M3NmFkODRhMTdhN2Y1MDNlNjE2NGI&scc=1), and slots can be signed up for electronically.
