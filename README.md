*This repo includes materials for the General Assembly Data Science course in NYC. Navigate the directory structure to find what you're looking for. The `README.md` files are often the most central in a directory, and will display by default when you navigate on github.*

### Getting Help

**Github Issues**

For general or specific course help, students can get the fastest response by posting an issue, to the [issues page for this repository](https://github.com/TeachingDataScience/data-science-course/issues)

* Chris will be reviewing each issue and will assign it to Ed, Dave or himself.
* Students and other instructors following the repository will also be able to address the issue, improving response time.
    
    
**Office Hours**
