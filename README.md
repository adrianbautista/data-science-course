### Getting Help

**Github Issues**

For general or specific course help, students can get the fastest response by posting an issue, to the [issues page for this repository](https://github.com/TeachingDataScience/data-science-course/issues)

* Chris will be reviewing each issue and will assign it to Ed, Dave or himself.
* Students and other instructors following the repository will also be able to address the issue, improving response time.


**Office Hours**

Ed and Dave will hold regular office hours, and Chris will hold regular weekend sessions.
