## Lesson 3 - Numpy

## Objectives

* Pick up from Monday's class:
   * Python setup(s) for class
     * ipython
     * ipython notebook
     * text editors and terminal window  
   
   * Pyton basics
     * data structures, 
     * control flows 
     * and functions.
     
 * Understand the utility and basic functions of Numpy and the NDArray

## Before

* This [linear algebra reference](http://cs229.stanford.edu/section/cs229-linalg.pdf) is a must read, particularly as a good general review on notation and concepts.
* [A good (22 page) linear algebra cheat sheet](http://aerostudents.com/files/linearAlgebra/linearAlgebraFullVersion.pdf) 
* This [short review](http://codebright.wordpress.com/2011/10/07/linear-algebra-review-and-numpy/), which is a Python version of some of the linear algebra review from Andrew Ng's machine learning course on Coursera, will introduce some light matrix manipulation in numpy.
* Finally, we find the [cookbook](http://wiki.scipy.org/Cookbook) from SciPy to be a useful bookmarkâ€“I recommend going through the examples from the "numpy arrays" and "linear algebra" sections.

## During

* [Python Exercises](python_exercises.md)
* [Running Code in the I-Python Notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/TeachingDataScience/data-science-course/blob/forstudentviewing/03_numpy/lec_03_IPythonNBIntro.ipynb)
* [Linear Algebra Review](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/TeachingDataScience/data-science-course/blob/forstudentviewing/03_numpy/lec_03_linear_algebra.ipynb)
* [Numpy and Pandas](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/TeachingDataScience/data-science-course/blob/forstudentviewing/03_numpy/lec_03_numpy_and_pandas.ipynb)

## After
* Complete (duplicate) and submit the [10 minutes to Pandas exercises](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/10min.html#min)
* Skim the [Pandas Cook-Book](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/jvns/pandas-cookbook/tree/v0.1/cookbook/)
