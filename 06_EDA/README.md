# Exploratory Data Analysis

**Key Materials**

* [Class Notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/TeachingDataScience/data-science-course/blob/forstudentviewing/06_EDA/06_EDA_Main_Notebook.ipynb)

## Objectives
* Understand the importance of Exploratory Data Analysis
* Be able to recite the steps of EDA, and explain each one, and implement each step with python
* Use statistical methods and distributions to explain data
* Be able to produce an exploratory report on a given data set in one hour.

## Before
* Complete the data visualization assignment
* Identify a dataset relative to your project and
   * Create a data dictionary describing each variable
   * Run df.describe() and explain the output
   * Create meaningful subsets of your data
   * Graph your data with histograms
 

## During

* Lecture on the ACES framework
* Code along with advanced data exploration
* Independent and group work on data exploration


## After



## Resources

* Review the [Data Exploration](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/alpinedatalabs/ODST@master/.tree/notebooks) notebooks at ODST
