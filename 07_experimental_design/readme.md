Please work on your project for next week. Presentations are coming up soon!

### Questions

* Does the headline match the content of the story?
* Do you think the reporting does injustice to the science?
* What's wrong with the claims of causality?
* What are alternate, plausible explanations of their results?
* Could they have analyzed their data more properly?

**advanced**

* What inferences are actually possible given their data?
* How are they implemented in python?
* If the experiment was flawed, what would have been a proper design?
* Is this practical? If not, how close do you think they could have gotten?
