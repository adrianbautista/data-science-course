# Data Visualization with Matplotlib and Pandas

*Scheduled for Wednesday, 9/17/14*

## Objectives


* Illustrate the importance of data visualization to data analysis by using a historic example
* Quickly produce exploratory plots from Pandas, including histograms, scatterplots, scattermatrices, lineplots and bar plots
* Use the structure of matplotlib to customize plots
* Independently visualize a basic data set
* Describe the core data structures of geo mapping.



## Before

* **Assignment:** [Submit a Project Idea!](../project_idea_submission.md)
* Pick a dataset from [Enigma](https://github.com/TeachingDataScience/data-science-course/blob/forstudentviewing/s_data_sources/enigma.md) or, if you like, related to your project topic to use during a class exercise.
* Skim the Rougier [MatPlotLib Tutorial](http://www.loria.fr/~rougier/teaching/matplotlib/)

  
## During

* Lecture on data visualization
* Lecture/code along on data visualization with pandas and matplotlib
    * Matplotlib Plotting - Rougier
    * Pandas Plotting - Pandas docs
* Independent work on plotting

### Proposed Timing

6:30 PM	Intro
7:00 PM	Lecture
7:30 PM	Notebook Coding
8:00 PM	Group Work
8:30 PM	Reconvene
9:00 PM	Assignment and Data Search


### Assignment

** A. Basic Plots**
* Create an original histogram, lineplot, scatterplot, and scattermatrix from your data
* If you cannot create one of the four plots due to the data, explain why
* Include multiple variables on one or many charts
* Clearly label all axes
* Make sure each graph is clearly labelled
  
** B. Advanced Plots**
* Create a trellis plot from a dataset.  Explain the benefits of the trellis plot view.
* Import Seaborn (or bokeh or vincent) and recreate your initial exploratory charts

** C. Highly Advanced** (optional)
* Recreate the [finanial chart](http://matplotlib.org/users/screenshots.html#financial-charts) from the mpl demo.  See how far you can get.  You'll learn a tremendous amount on the nuances of MPL in each stage.


## After

* Watch Andrew Montalenti's ["Rapid Data Visualization"](http://vimeo.com/79580138)
   * Includes Pandas; D3.js; NVD3.js; Vega / Vincent; and PhantomJS. 
* View Wickham's [Grammar of Graphics Slides](http://www.slideshare.net/hadley/grammar-of-graphics-past-present-future)
