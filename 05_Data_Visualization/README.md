# Data Visualization with Matplotlib and Pandas

*Scheduled for Wednesday, 9/17/14*

## Objectives


* Illustrate the importance of data visualization to data analysis by using a historic example
* Quickly produce exploratory plots from Pandas, including histograms, scatterplots, scattermatrices, lineplots and bar plots
* Use the structure of matplotlib to customize plots
* Independently visualize a basic data set
* Describe the core data structures of geo mapping.



## Before

* Choose a dataset from enigma.io to visualize during an in-class exercise
  * **Note:** We'll be working in pairs, so make sure you have the data accessible in a dataframe (or know that its easily accessible)
  * **Note:** If you have a data set for your project, feel free to use that.
* Review the Rougier [MatPlotLib Tutorial](http://www.loria.fr/~rougier/teaching/matplotlib/)

  
## During

* Lecture on data visualization
* Lecture/code along on data visualization with pandas and matplotlib
* Independent work on plotting
* 

## After

* Watch Andrew Montalenti's ["Rapid Data Visualization"](http://vimeo.com/79580138)
   * Includes Pandas; D3.js; NVD3.js; Vega / Vincent; and PhantomJS.
