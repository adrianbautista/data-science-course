**A. Basic Plots**

* Create an original histogram, lineplot, scatterplot, and scattermatrix from your data
* If you cannot create one of the four plots due to the data, explain why
* Include multiple variables on one or many charts
* Use the grid or axes layout to place and plot multiple graphs in one figure
* Clearly label all axes, include titles on all plots and sub plots.
  
**B. Advanced Plots** (optional)

* Create a trellis plot from a dataset.  Explain the benefits of the trellis plot view.
* Import another graphics library such as Seaborn (or bokeh or vincent) and recreate your initial exploratory charts

**C. Highly Advanced** (optional)
* Recreate the [finanial chart](http://matplotlib.org/users/screenshots.html#financial-charts) from the mpl demo.  See how far you can get.  You'll learn a tremendous amount on the nuances of MPL in each stage.
