## Next Steps/Homework
Continue iterating on the twitter data set. What new features could you curate that could be predictive of a hashtag?

Consider:

1. length of a tweet, or number of tokens in a tweet
2. Finding more words to include in the sentiment dictionary
3. Finding words most commonly used along a hashtag.

add to the code, and build a better model using your new features.

**OR**

follow a different persuit with the data, given that you can work with the twitter api, which will provide you with much more data than included in the master csv file here.
