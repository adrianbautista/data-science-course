# Check in with Instructor 

**By Wednesday, October 15th:**

Have a 15 minute meeting with one of the instructors to discuss how we can help you get the most from this class.  Topics might include:

* Your career goals and interests
* Where you'd like to be with data science in 3 months... in 6 months... in 3 years... ?
* Which areas you'd most like to improve on
* Which data science topics outside the curriculum you'd like to learn about
* etc.

We've randomly assigned students to each instructor (below).

Please contact the instructor you've been assigned to and setup a meeting -- it can be in office hours, via phone, hangout, etc.

Once you've had a meeting, submit to the assignments form (just say "met" in the link form).
