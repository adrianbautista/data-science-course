Continue plugging away at the titanic data set to see if you can come up with a **better** predictor than what we built above using either DT, RF, or naive bayes!

You will want to spend **MOST** of your time continuing to manipulate the data set, creating new features, and understanding the relationship between these features and how they contribute to predicting the "survived" data.

Please work with a partner and pair program.
