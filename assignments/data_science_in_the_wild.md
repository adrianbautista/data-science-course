# Data Science in the Wild

Each class, a student may present a recent, real world example of the specific day's topic.

To find examples, students might use:
* Recent papers from google scholar
* Recent news about a metric or company that leverages the topic
* An NYC-based meetup or other upcoming event involving the topic

Presenting students should check the syllabus for the class topic on their day.

As an example, if the topic was "Linear Regression", the student might present any of the following:

* A [recent study](http://cercor.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2014/07/08/cercor.bhu137.short) leveraging linear regression for brain imaging.
* An brief summary of a [recent blog post](http://www.advisorperspectives.com/dshort/updates/Regression-to-Trend.php) that uses regression to analyze the stock market
* Explain a specific question you have about Linear Regression, how you tried to answer it, and why its interesting to you.
* Provide an example of how the student hopes to use linear regression for their project

**Format:**
* Student should submit their topic ahead of the class as an 'issue', with a brief explanation and any relevant links
* No slides
* 3 to 5 minutes
* Showing a web page is okay
