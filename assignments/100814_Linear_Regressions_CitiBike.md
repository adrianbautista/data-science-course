## Homework submission

included in [./data](https://github.com/TeachingDataScience/data-science-course/tree/forstudentviewing/09_linear_regression/data) is a dataset called `days.csv`, which is the number of registered and nonregistered (casual) bike share users given a particular day and other features (wind speed, actual temperature, and "feeling temperature" (atemp). 

Please do not use "cnt" in your models, as that's the count of registered + casual riders.

1. Build a multiple linear regression predicting registered users, and another for predicting non registered users.
2. Your output files should easily replicate an R-Squared value for each model. We'll measure your success based on R-Squared and share results with the rest of the class on Wednesday.
3. Your output should include comments that explain how the models are different and how some variables better explain registered users vs non registered.
