Create a twitter classifier with naive bayes and check the sentiment for a keyword of your choice.

You'll need your own twitter api key.  

For the training set, you can use the "STS-Gold Sentiment Corpus".  [CSV is here.](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/datadave/47ed59dd8733b2063dc6/raw/583615c70a1167fcd72899b2d2830493f1c616e6/sts_gold_tweet.csv)


Turn in a (link to your) nicely formatted notebook with your well-commented code.  You can use this and the previous assignment's code as guidelines.
