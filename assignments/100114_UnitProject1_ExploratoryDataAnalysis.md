# Unit Project 1: Exploratory Data Analysis

**After the project, you will be able to:**

*   Store data in a DataFrame, and export it in some shape or form (text file, database, json text files)
*   Visualize data through means of Matplotlib or ggplot (the matplotlib wrapper)
*   Provide insight about the data in front of your peers

**Contents Include**

* Exploratory Data Analysis of your data set including visuals, subsets, acquistion notes, etc.
* Preliminary questions for your project
* Well organized ipython notebook with code and output.
* 5 minute presentation: A descriptive and visual tour of your dataset

**Due Date and Grade Scale**

*   Projects will be due October 1st, 2014.

    *   You'll be presenting your projects in small groups on that class day, so come prepared
    *   Expect to see all projects turned in before the beginning of class
    *   If you get it to us earlier, Dave and I will try to provide early feedback

**You will Submit**

*   All code (language of their choice, but preferably Python)
*   All data (preferably compressed in a text file, or the python code should be able to reproduce the dataset)
*   Short deck in pdf format, including the short introductory piece.

**Going the Extra Mile**

*   You can (and should!) rework your project into a post on your own blog. It's encouraged to share your work within your social networks.
*   Engineers should consider exploring frameworks for deploying visuals on the web: d3.js, shiny (you'd also have to learn R, which is encouraged), iPython Notebook

**Lesson material in order to complete Project**

*   Fundamental Statistics Review
*   Python Basics and Using Libraries/Modules
*   Data collection, storage, and manipulation
*   Data visualization in Python

**Next Steps**

*   Consider how the data collected could be used in predictive analytics application
