# Data Results

## Objectives
* How to analyze the distributions in your data with scatterplots and histograms
* How to use data relationships to get results
* Interepretation of statsmodels coefficient tables

## Activities

### Before

* Please be comfortable with pandas as we'll primarily be using that alongside introducing new libraries today

### During

* [Lab Today](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/teachingdatascience/data-science-course/blob/forstudentviewing/08_data_results/lab.ipynb)

## Additonal Resources

* [Reading coefficient tables, 1](http://blog.yhathq.com/posts/r-lm-summary.html) For R, but the stats are still the same as statsmodels.
* [Reading coefficient tables, 2](http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/59250/how-to-interpret-the-output-of-the-summary-method-for-an-lm-object-in-r) A different approach to reading the lm output. Also for R, but just as useful.
* [Understanding ANOVA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yQb_ZJnFXw) A visual way to understand ANOVA tables and the F-test.
* [F-Test](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/probability/statistics-inferential/anova/v/anova-3-hypothesis-test-with-f-statistic) Another video of the above, presented in a different fashion
* [Statistical Distributions](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~ADAMODAR/New_Home_Page/StatFile/statdistns.htm) Introduction to other distributions
