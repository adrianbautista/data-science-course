# Intro to Python (for Data Science)

![](https://www.python.org/~guido/images/license.jpg)

## Objectives

* To understand the primary data structures in python and the do's and don'ts of their functionality
* To understand what is Object Oriented Programming and how it plays a role in data science,
* To understand Classes and subclassing
* To understand other python/programming idioms: return, yield/iterator, loop, ternary, function, modules
  
## Before

* Python's [informal introduction to python](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/introduction.html) will walk you through the basics (one more time)
* It's recommended to walk through at least exercises 1 - 5 of this [data science for python notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/gumption/Python_for_Data_Science/blob/master/Python_for_Data_Science_all.ipynb). It also introduces you to some of what we'll talk about in more detail later in class, but we think it provides a good scope of what's to come, and how knowing python well smooths out the learning process.
* This [intro to object oriented programming](http://code.tutsplus.com/articles/python-from-scratch-object-oriented-programming--net-21476) (for python) reviews the concepts of classes at a very basic level. If you're looking for something more gritty, this stackoverflow goes over the whole spiel in quite detail. Don't fret if you find it confusing--it's complicated! Feel free to skip over the actual answer to the question (about metaclasses).
